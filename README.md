## Pitch

> Our web appication is "EasyRent".
It will be written on the Flask platform using Angular Front-End framework.
It will be constructed as the Car Renting service, which allows user to register and login into platform. Then choose available car in three ctegories like econom, premium and luxury. When user rent, and car arrives to his location.
In comparison to another car renting services EasyRent won't charge additional fee(залог). And we add disconts those who rent car for few days.
